The Oscars are today and while I will likely not be watching them, I have watched a few of this years nominees. Here are my thoughts on the movies I have seen, in order of preference.

### Sound of Metal

Everything came together nicely in the end with his final moments of stillness. Very character based but the lead actor did a great job.

### The Trial of the Chicago 7

I enjoyed how they weaved in the story of the protests as the trial proceeded as well as the stand up session that Sacha Baron Cohens character performed. The judge was awful, frustrating to see the injustice.

### Minari

This movie seemed to have a few more layers, and I thought the quality of the movie was good. The story line was a bit weak but perhaps this is just because it didn't have a nicely wrapped up ending like most movies.

### Judas and the Black Messiah

Interesting how the events of this movie overlap some with that of the Trial of the Chicago 7. Very moving story and again the injustice of the time was awful. The movie it self was a bit slow and not as enjoyable as the others.

Best Picture Nominations I have not watched:

- Mank
- Promising Woman
- The Father
- Nomadland

-- Mitch

## Quote of the Week

> I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality... I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word. - **Martin Luther King Jr.**

## Favourite Things of The Week

### Atlas Shrugged - Ayn Rand

A classic. Been on my list for a while.

### Game of Thrones - George R. R. Martin (Audiobook)

Roy Dotrice, the narrator of the audiobook, does a great job. He has voices for each character and adds emotion into the story without overdoing it.

### Jack Johnson - In Between Dreams Album

As basic as it may be it is a good one. I also think it is cool how he was part of the "Momentum Generation" in surfing.
