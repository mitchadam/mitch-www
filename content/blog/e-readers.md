I have been doing the majority of my reading on the Kobo eReader. It took time to adjust to but I have really been enjoying it. Today I will share three reasons why I think eReaders are great. (The reasons I enjoy using it are reflective of all eReaders, I donâ€™t think the specific model I am using is anything special. )

### 1) Instant Access to Books

Being able to instantly download any book I want to read has significantly increased the variety of my reading. This has allowed me to read exactly the books I want to read and not be restricted to what books I can obtain physically. Whenever I am looking for a new book I look through my want to reads list on GoodReads and download it. This also increases the amount of reading I do as I always have I book I want to read. The times where I read the least are when I donâ€™t have a book or am not interested in the one I am reading.

### 2) Highlighting Books

I take notes on the majority of the books I read (at least all of the non-fiction) and always struggled with what the best method to do this ones. Taking notes in a separate journal was often time consuming and I would end up taking less notes. Highlighting the book directly made it difficult to look over notes afterwards and was an issue if you were borrowing the book. Highlighting on the Kobo is great because it is easy to do (so I actually do it) and I can export all my notes to my laptop where I can then summarize them and relate them to other books/ideas. I find this to be an especially useful feature when reading non-fiction. My only complaint is that while you can attach notes to your highlights, typing on the kobo is horrendous.

### 3) Connivence

I often like to read multiple books at once and it is a pain carrying around a pile of books, even if it is around the house. It is the worst when you sit down to read and realize you donâ€™t have the book that you want. The Kobo solves this problem as it stores many books. It is often nice if I am going somewhere, or between Edmonton and Canmore, all I need to do is throw in the Kobo and I know that I will have all the books I want. And it is small and not heavy.

I am quite converted to using an eReader, especially when reading fiction. However, the feel of the eReader the same as a physical book. When I read fiction before bed it is often a physical book.
