Every Sunday morning I head to my local coffee shop and write a blog post, and you should too. It doesn‚Äôt have to be Sunday morning over coffee (although I recommend this) but I believe everyone should write a blog. It is a great way to reflect, practice writing, and share with others.

### Reflection

Sitting down and writing about something forces you to think more deeply about it. In the process of defending your opinions, you also question them. Why is it that I think this way? Writing helps organize your thoughts. Often our thoughts are chaotic and unstructured. When writing you break things down into sections and make definitive statements. As a right-brain-leaning analytical person, I have found this to be helpful.

Additionally, in the process of choosing what to write about, one also spends time reflecting on what it is they have been thinking about. This process has encouraged me to reflect on what I can learn from recent experiences. I often learn more about the things I don‚Äôt write about but still spend time pondering.

### Writing

Writing is the most important form of communication, especially in the professional world. A huge aspect of the professional world is being able to communicate persuasively via writing. A resume, a cold email, or a website are all dependent upon being able to communicate one's point clearly and effectively. Writing a blog is an excellent way to practice this. There is no way one's writing won‚Äôt improve if one sits down and blogs every week.

On an even simpler level, writing a blog demystifies writing. Having to write something important is daunting. In school writing an essay always seemed like a mountain that needed to be climbed. By writing often, one becomes more comfortable with the act of writing. It makes writing seem like less of a big deal.

### Sharing

A blog is a great way to share your thoughts and life with other people. The asynchronous nature of writing in combination with the internet allows you to reach many more people than you would otherwise. And sharing with people is nice. It is an excellent way for people close to you to stay up to date, and for people not so close to you to get to know you. This works the other way as well. It is great to read people's responses to what you have to say and allows you to get to know them.

I think it is more important to be ‚Äúknown well‚Äù than to be ‚Äúwell known‚Äù. That is it is better to be known deeply by a few people than shallowly by many. Not only does this lead to stronger connections, but on a selfish level it leads to more opportunities. By forcefully inserting yourself into others‚Äô lives or inboxes every week, you will be on the person's mind more than you would otherwise. This has the potential to lead to more opportunities socially, professionally, and otherwise.

If anyone starts a blog, I will be the first subscriber! Notion is a very easy way to get started and is what I use. I have really been enjoying writing these posts recently, hopefully they illicit a slightly positive emotional reaction in those who chose to read.

## Favorite Things of The Week

### üì∫¬†[Charisma on Command](https://www.youtube.com/c/Charismaoncommand)

Interesting insights into human behavior. I find the breakdowns of talk show hosts interesting. You don‚Äôt realize how much goes into the persona of the hosts.

### ‚òï¬†[Verve Coffee](https://www.vervecoffee.com/)

Tried out a new coffee shop this week. Verve is a chain known for its quality coffee. The shop was bumping, definitely the ‚Äúit‚Äù spot in town.

### üëñ¬†[Lulu Lemon ABC Pants](https://shop.lululemon.com/p/mens-trousers/Abc-Slim-5-Pocket-32/_/prod9390007?color=0001)

I got these before leaving on my travels this summer and they have become my favorite pair of pants. A good balance of comfort and style.
