Meta released their new virtual reality headset this week, the Quest Pro. Featuring some pretty interesting capabilities, such as eye tracking and mixed reality, the Quest Pro really shows off what may be possible with VR in the coming years. This model is a higher-end model targeted at businesses, rather than consumers. The consumer headset is the Quest 2, which has already been out for a couple of years. Meta plans to alternate releases of the consumer and business models every year, for the foreseeable future.

Up to this point, VR experiences have been focused on gaming and entertainment. The Quest Pro is the first product that focuses on the productivity and work side of VR. I am much more interested in these aspects of VR. There are three areas that I believe could be significantly enhanced by VR.

### Social

While video calls are better than voice calls, and a far cry better than writing letters or sending telegraphs, there is still room for improvement.

On a voice call, there is no eye contact. If you look at the camera, for the other person it appears as if you are making eye contact with them, but you are looking at the camera not their eyes. If you look at their eyes, you‚Äôre not looking at the camera. In group video calls side conversations are not possible. Only one conversation can happen at a time, meaning it is difficult for everyone to be engaged. I am sure everyone can remember a painful group zoom call during covid. Additionally, there is no concept of space. Much of human memory is tied to the concept of space, meaning it is difficult for us to retain and process the events of video calls. A day of zoom meetings all seems to blend together.

However, video calls are better than all the forms of communication that came before them. The information bandwidth is much higher than through text, or even voice because of the addition of visual cues. At the time of the telegraph, voice didn‚Äôt seem possible. At the time of voice, video didn‚Äôt seem possible. At each stage, an additional form of information was added to the communication process. It follows then that there should be another form of communication that improves upon video which includes these other forms of information transmission such as eye contact and body language.

Moving away from family and having friends dispersed across cities, I would greatly appreciate said form of improved communication. To be able to hang in the same room as family, or play poker with friends all in different locations would be awesome. It would be another step in ‚Äúshrinking the world‚Äù. The Quest Pro already contains eye tracking, making eye contact possible, and spatial audio, so you can whisper to the person sitting next to you. I believe another important factor in determining the quality of the VR social experience is facial expressions and realistic avatars.

During the release event, they did demo some pretty amazing avatars. I do not believe that this level of quality is real-time and available in the current headsets, but once it is I think VR will be leaps ahead of video calls. This is what I am most excited about in VR. Here is the avatar demo they provided in the event, it's pretty crazy.

### Productivity

Another VR feature I am interested in is virtual monitors. Rather than having computer monitors that you connect to your laptop, you can put on a headset and use virtual monitors instead. Since the headset is mixed reality, you will still be able to see your laptop and desk, but virtual monitors will be projected into your field of view. This means that anywhere you go you can have your ideal work setup, all you need is a laptop and a headset.

Here is a demo of this feature. From what I have read online I don‚Äôt think this feature is at the point where it is ready to be used. Humans are very sensitive to visual latency, and I think that the quality and responsiveness of virtual monitors still need improvement before they will be viable to use.

### Design

I think the 3D nature of VR lends itself to design work. Being able to quickly create designs and move them around 3D space is something I can see having utility. While I don‚Äôt foresee myself using this as much, I do think this will be a big aspect of the practical side of VR. Mixed reality adds an additional component to this where it would be possible to also design objects and quickly be able to see them in the physical world. Or to be able to sample how a couch would look in your living room.

They have had a few Oculus Pros on campus but I have not yet had a chance to demo one yet. I am hoping to try one out soon and see how far these things are from being a (physical) reality.

Really enjoyed this one. Interesting story and extremely well written.

### üì±[Todist App](https://todoist.com/app/)

Starting using this as my to-do list app. To-do lists are most effective if they are completely comprehensive, so I have been adding everything I can. There is a lock screen widget on IOS which makes it easy to add.
