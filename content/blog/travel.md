Tourism is one of the biggest industries in the world, contributing **8.7 trillion dollars** (10.4%) to global GDP in 2019. Why do people like travelling so much they are willing to spend trillions of dollars on it? As I prepare for my travels this summer, I wanted to reflect what it is I like about traveling.

### ⏰ Change From Routine

Travel is something different, simple as that. Day to day routine can become monotonous, and travel acts as a break. Not only is the structure of your day different, but one is also exposed to new sights, smells and other senses. This new environment means you are more present and engaged in the current moment.

One is probably not thinking about their taxes when they walk by the Colosseum for the first time. This is not true of a local Roman who walks by it every day. Going for coffee in Rome is likely more exciting than going to you local coffee shop, even though it is the same activity. It is engaging because it is new, meaning you spend less time living inside your head.

### 🎏 Exposure to Different Cultures

Travel exposes you to different cultures and ways of life making you appreciate the diversity of the world. Experiencing other cultures exposes you to new ideas and ways of thinking, broadening ones world view. While I think this makes someone a more well rounded individual, I also think it develops a greater sense of empathy for other people and cultures. This is especially important living in western countries as it makes us realize the high quality of life that we have. This realization leads to a greater appreciation for comforts and freedoms that we normally take for granted.

### 🏛️ Engagement with History

When one travels, they often visit the tourist attractions in the area. While sometimes hokey, these attractions often have important historical significance. Visiting these places forces one to engage more deeply with history and learn things they likely would not have otherwise learned. It is much more exciting to lean about Roman history at the Colosseum than it is to read a text book.

Additionally, I think the appeal of many of these attractions is not the site itself, but in the way they prompt ones imagination. The appeal of the Colosseum is not walking around a dilapidated stone stadium surrounded by tourists listening to audio tours using selfie sticks. The appeal is being there and imaging a packed crowd yelling as gladiator fight lions to the death, in a time long before the internet and stimulation overload. How insane must it have been???

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Meeting People

Yes, travel allows you to meet locals and other travellers from around the world. However, I think there are additional aspects that make the relationships you make travelling unique. Anyone you meet you will likely only know for a short period of time, and you both know nothing about each other or each others lives. From my experience, these dynamics make people more open and connections happen more quickly. It is also likely that you will engage in an experience that is new to both of you. This creates an interesting relation between the experience and the relationship with the other person. This is my favourite aspect of solo travel.

I plan on being intentionally conscious of these things while travelling, and appreciating each one. Now that exams are finished, I am ready to be wheels up! First stop: Portugal 🇵🇹
