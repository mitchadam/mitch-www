One of my favourite apps is Goodreads. Goodreads is a social media site focused on books. The app allows you to track books, read reviews and share what you are reading. Here are three things I like about Goodreads:

### Tracking and Reviews

Anytime I am recommended a book I immediately add it to my “To Read” list on Goodreads. Previously I had miscellaneous notes on my phone tracking book recommendations. Without a central repository for this information it was difficult to sift through and find what I wanted to read next.

Additionally, Goodreads has information about each book including descriptions, ratings and user reviews. This is great when deciding on the next read as I am able to learn what the book is about and read reviews from other users. You are also able to sort lists of books by average rating. This is much better then just the book title in the notes app with no context.

### Sharing with Friends

Goodreads also allows you to connect with your friends. This means I can see the books my friends have read and what they have rated each book. Seeing what others are reading is another great way to find book recommendations. I also find it interesting to see what books people are reading. Similar to my records post from last week, the books people read shed insight into who they are.

### Gamification

I find that Goodreads also adds a gamification aspect of reading. I love the feeling of adding a book to my Read list and giving it a review. This encourages me to read more. As an extension of this I have the books from my Goodreads accounts synced to my website [here](https://www.mitchadam.com/pages/Books.html).

I also find that since I track the books I read, I am more aware of what I am reading. This has lead to me read more diversely as I will notice that I have read a few similar books and try to find something different.

Overall, Goodreads has allowed me to find a broad range of high quality books and adds fun additional aspects to reading.

## Favourite Things of The Week

### 📕 Guns, Germ and Steel - Jared Diamond

Still working my way through this one. Pretty good so far but dives deeper into the biology than I would care for.

### 🎵 [Lips of an Angel - Hinder](https://open.spotify.com/album/2SmDuZSWtjukp9gkG2mcBQ?si=rRu2h1Q9Q4ist24hrKnXkA)

Have had this one stuck in my head.

### 🥨 Miss Vickies Spicy Dill Pickle Chips

These are deadly.
