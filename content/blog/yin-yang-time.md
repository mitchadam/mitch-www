In ancient Chinese philosophy, Yin and Yang describes the complementary balance between opposing forces. This is the approach I take when it comes to time management, in what I call _Yin and Yang Time_.

There are three ways in which time can be spent.

- **Black time** - 100% focused, distraction free
- **White time** - Completely relaxed, free mind
- **Grey time** - Distracted work, or time you are only relaxed. Combination of black and white time

> 💡 As the Chinese proverb states, the key lies in the balance of opposing sides: black time and white time. Grey time breaks the balance, and should be avoided.

**Black time**, is time spent doing deep work. Deep work is intense concentration on a single task for an extended period of time, without any distractions. This concept comes from the book Deep Work by Cal Newport. **Black time allows one to get more done in less time, learn more effectively and produce at a higher level.** For more of my thoughts on deep work, see my post on [🎓 3 Skills](/blog/2022/three-skills).

The discipline of black time makes room for **white time**. By being completely focused while working, not only do you have the time to relax, but your mind can ‘turn off’ knowing you put in your best effort to get the work done. I find this allows me to be more present when I am doing leisure activities such as hanging with friends, and less guilty when I go on a YouTube binge at the end of the day. White time is about allowing yourself time where you completely turn off from work, so that you can appreciate and enjoy moments more. I discuss this more in my post [⚖️ Discipline and Enjoyment](/blog/2021/%EF%B8%8F-discipline-and-enjoyment/).

**Grey time** has no role in the balance of Yin and Yang and should be avoided. Grey time is white nor black, but a combination of the two where you experience benefits from neither. You are not completely focused, so work takes longer and expands to fill the time. Since you weren’t really that productive, you feel guilty about hanging with friends or watching YouTube. **Grey time breaks the balance** and leaves you feeling worn out but like you got nothing done at the same time.

I have written about some of these topics before, but I wanted to unify them together, and the Yin and Yang symbol adds a nice visual. I try to embody these ideas as much as possible, but of course I have my share of grey time. One aspect of writing these posts is re-enforce the ideas within myself, and to have something I can refer back to. While writing this post, I took one five minute break for a twitter scroll.
