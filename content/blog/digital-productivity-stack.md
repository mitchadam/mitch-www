Are you using technology correctly? I recently updated my digital productivity stack. I consolidated the software products I us and made it clear what each product should be used for. This has allowed me to be more effective, more organized, and less stressed. Here is my guide to the ultimate digital productivity system.

The system resolves around a single thesis: **Write everything down.** Literally everything. Whether as a to-do list item, calendar event, or stream of conscious notes, transfer everything from your brain into zeros and ones. Our brains are best at creative thinking and problem solving, not remembering. Writing things down frees your brain to do what it is most effective at, think.

Two things need to be achieved by the ultimate productivity system. First, it needs to be easy to write things down so things actually get written down. Second, it should be clear where to write things down so that they can be found later. In order to achieve these goals, three components are needed: a to-do list app, a note-taking app, and a calendar.

### To-do List App

Using a to-do list app properly is game-changing. In order to be effective, a to-do list needs to be 100% comprehensive. If the list is only 90% comprehensive you are still left to wonder what the other 10% is. The purpose of a to-do list is so that you don‚Äôt have to wonder what needs to be done, it is all on the list.

The to-do list should be the lowest friction way to write something down. To achieve this download the app on all your devices and add widgets to your phone. The fewer clicks needed to add a todo the better. To make things even easier, use an inbox-based system.

Any to-do list item is initially added to the inbox section. This allows you to quickly jot down a to-do list while on the go and not spend time putting it in the correct place. Later when you are back at your computer prioritize and categorize the todos. Have separate lists for different projects, such as work or school. Break up lists into different priority levels such as ‚ÄúDo ASAP‚Äù, ‚ÄúDo at some point‚Äù and ‚ÄúNice to do‚Äù. This allows you to track things that are not mandatory without clogging up the list.

I use Todist.

### Notes App

Note-taking apps are essential for thought dumps and information storage. Any material that you think you may want to reference later should be written down in a notes app. If you are researching something, like how to import a car to the US, create a page where you can store relevant links, excerpts, and information. This allows you to reference this information later and quickly pick up where you left off.

Note apps are also great for brain dumps. If you have a tough decision to make, create a note which is a stream of all your thoughts on the topic. You may never reference the note again but the act of writing it down helps organize your thoughts. However, if you do need to come back to this decision later, all of your thoughts are there for you to read. You can then determine if you still agree with your original change of thought, or have since changed your mind.

It is important not to have too many note-taking apps. If you use too many note-taking apps it is difficult to find where things are written down. I use two note-taking apps, one for short life span notes and one for longer life span notes. It is important to distinguish between the two. Short life span notes are things like a brain dump of what I need to get done that day or grocery lists. I probably won‚Äôt come back to them and just want to get my thoughts out quickly. Long life span notes are ones that I will come back to in the future. Things such as interview prep notes, book notes, or notes on investing fall into this category.

I use Apple Notes for short life span notes and Notion for long life span notes.

### Calendar

There is no reason your brain should remember the times of events. Trying to remember events increases the chance of forgetting and adds mental burden. Add everything, even the little things, as calendar events. This includes things like plans with friends, important work dates, or even when you are planning to go the gym.

Reminders are also a powerful calendar tool that should be used liberally. Whenever you subscribe to a free trial, add a reminder to cancel the subscription so you don‚Äôt get stuck paying for something you don‚Äôt want. Reminders can also be set up for reoccurring events such as paying rent or reminding you to check your budget. This is an easy way to stay organized and to prompt yourself to do things that are easily overlooked (like checking your budget).

I use Google Calendar.

### Bonus: Voice memos with transcription

Voice memos are a great way of performing a brain dump. Simply start recording and spew your thoughts. Many services offer transcription of voice memos, which means you can view the transcript of the memo. A transcript is far superior to the actual voice memo. In order to get information out of a voice memo you need to actually listen to the thing which is slow and painful. A transcript however you can skim and ctrl+f for the information you actually want without reading the entire thing.

I have been recording voice memos and attaching the transcript to the relevant todos list items. This means the todo is written down and all of my thoughts related to the todo are also written down. This allows me to, in theory, completely put it out of my brain. I know that I can, and will, come back later and have all the information available to me.

The most important aspect of a digital productivity system is that it is easy to use. If it is not easy to use you are not going to use it. Don‚Äôt complicate things by focusing on things that don‚Äôt matter like formatting your notes consistently and color-coding your calendar. **Just focus on one thing: writing things down.**

## Favorite Things of The Week

### üè´¬†Digital Courses

I bought a few courses online to help with interview prep and they have been great. It has been a reminder that **anything can be learned from the internet**. Online courses are a great way to ensure you continue to learn. You could probably find the content for free but the convenience of having it laid out for you increases the chance you will actually follow through with it. I think courses are a good use of money and I plan to buy more in the future.

### üç®¬†Protein Ice Cream

I enjoy this as a post-dinner treat.
