One of my staple dinner meals is a green curry concoction. It's easy, healthy and has good flavour. The key ingredient is green curry paste which can pack a punch. It is one of my favourite self-made meals but every time I add waaay to much curry paste. Five minutes in and my eyes are watering and the hiccups start. I am always worried about it being too bland... guess I just haven't learned my lesson yet.

This was todays meal of choice and as I sat here with tears coming out of my eyes and nose running, I thought "Why do people eat spicy food anyway?". After some time spent perusing the internet, I found three main reasons.

### 1) Food Preservation

Adding spice to food helps to slow down bacterial growth. This means that it is possible to store food longer without it going bad. Back in the days before refrigerators, this was a big deal. Cultures with the highest spice tolerance are centred around the equator. In these tropical places, the warmer temperatures meant food spoiled more quickly than in the colder regions away of the equaotr. Hence, spicy foods are often part of these cultures.

### 2)Endorphins

Food feels "spicy" because your body registers it as pain, even though it isn't causing harm. This happens when the chemical capsaicin hits your taste buds. Now oddly enough, this causes your body to release endorphins, providing a sense of pleasure. Simply put, eating spicy food feels good.

### #) Preference

Some people just like spicy things, like with other flavour personal preference is a a big component. I have found I have grown more found of spicy food and my tolerance has increased. However, it is all fun and games until you go to take your contacts out after eating "Suicide hot" chicken wings...

This is all quite high level, but some interesting follow up questions:

- How does the capsaicin simulate pain but not cause harm?
- How are scovilles measured?
- How do taste buds work?
