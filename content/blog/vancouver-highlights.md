Hello everyone, after a brief hiatus I am back to the blog. I took a break for a few weeks while in Vancouver to enjoy the summer and produce future blog content. I had a great time in Vancouver and would like to share some of my highlights.

### Climbing in Squamish

We made the trek to Squamish a number of times to hit the crags. The drive along the Sea to Sky Highway is very scenic, and Squamish is a great place to be. On many of the hot days we followed up our climbing sessions with a swim in the lake.

### Vancouver Breweries

Vancouver has lots of great breweries and we took full advantage of this. One of our favourite weekend activities was a brewery bike tour. I still love the Belgian beers.

### Tofino Trip

Over August long I tagged along on a camping trip to Tofino with William and his friends. We surfed, hiked to a crashed plane and ate fish tacos. Someone thought it would be a good idea to give William a recorder, so we were fortunate enough to have a constant supply of live music.

### Sunsets

My place in Vancouver was perhaps not the most luxurious establishment, however it was close to the aptly named sunset beach! I spent most evenings listening to an audio book walking the sea wall.

### Work

I had a successful internship with Amazon. I am glad I went down to Vancouver as I was able to go into the office and meet the majority of the team. It was nice to have to get ready to leave the house, and the cold brew on tap didn't hurt either.

Very happy I was able to go to Vancouver this summer and get out lots with the easing of restrictions. Hoping to spend more time there in the future with the YVR gang.

## Favourite Things of The Week

### The Stand - Stephen King

Just started this book. Stephen King has been on my list for awhile and The Stand should be an interesting read post Covid

### [Elk Sounds Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gBk04ajuxk)

We went [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gBk04ajuxk)to the Elks game this weekend. I used to think that Elks was a lame name, but the sound of an elk is one of the most terrifying sounds I have ever heard.

### How to Change your Mind - Michael Pollan

Just finished the audio book. An interesting read, chapter 5 is worth resisting.
