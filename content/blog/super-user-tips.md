**The key to using a computer effectively is minimizing the time between thinking you want to do something, and that something being done.** In other words, minimizing the time spent doing things unrelated to the task on hand. If you are a writer, you want to spend your time on the computer writing. You don’t want to spend time searching for files, messing with formatting or looking up the spelling of a word.

As is the case for most of us, I spend more time in front of a screen than I would prefer. In an effort to spend less time, here are my tips on becoming a computer super user!

### Apps

**Alfred**

- This app is an absolute must. It is a beefed up Spotlight search.
- You can open apps, search files, and create custom workflows to automate repetitive tasks
- I could seriously not live without this app. Check it out [here](https://www.alfredapp.com/).

> 💡 Hit _option + c_ to open clipboard history and _control_ over a highlighted item to see available actions.

**Contexts**

- [Contexts](https://contexts.co/) is an improved window switcher which also allows you to switch between multiple windows of the same application.
- Much needed upgrade over the MacOS default

**Window Tiler**

- Mac lacks good window management.
- I use [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/) but there are other free versions available
- Make sure to learn the hot keys!!

### Chrome Extensions

**Ad Blocker**

- This is an another absolute must that everyone should have
- I use [Ad Block Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus-free-ad-bloc/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb)

**Video Speed controller**

- Easily control the speed of any video in intervals of 0.1x
- The hot keys are great to quickly slow the video down or speed it up further
- Check it out [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk?hl=en)

**Password Manager**

- A password manager will make your life 10x easier, and reduce your risk of being hacked
- Get the chrome extension and learn the keyboard shortcuts to auto-full passwords
- This makes logging in to anything painless. Seriously, get this set up.

> 💡 [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) is a free and trusted password manager. Hit _cmd + shift + L_ to auto fill the password.

### System Configuration

**Remove the Mac Dock**

- Remove everything from the Mac dock and make it hidden when not hovered. You should not be using it for anything
- Use Alfred and Contexts to switch between apps
- Also move the dock to the side if you do use it to maximize vertical screen real estate. Vertical screen real estate is more important than horizontal screen real estate.

**Max mouse speed**

- Set your mouse speed to max. It will take some time to get use to but it will be worth it.

**Take the time to configure repetitive tasks**

- Take note of what things you do repeatedly, and what things cause you pain when you have to do.
- It is worth the 10 minute google search to see if there is a way to make it easier or to automate it.

### Best Practices

**Store information**

- Be liberal storing information. This may mean bookmarking websites in chrome, or pasting things into notes.
- You may never come back to things, but when you need something you will be grateful to your past self.
- This means that you need to have organized systems to store this information so it can actually be found later. Too much information is the same as no information.

**Desktop as the inbox**

- I treat the desktop as an inbox, or my working folder. Anything I am actively working on I will save files directly to the desktop. This allows me to see everything I have on the go, and acts as a reminder of things to get done.
- However, nothing stays on the desktop forever. Everything must either be:
  - Acted on
  - Categorized and stored
  - Deleted
- This is similar to many inbox management systems where you have diligent categorization systems.

**Learn shortcuts**

- Take the time to learn key board shorts. They will be awkward at the start but will be infinitely worth it.
- I keep a note of shortcuts I am currently learning. If I forget what it is I can quickly check the note as a reminder. Eventually I don’t need the reminder anymore

> 💡 _cmd + shift + 8_ creates a list bulleted list in Google Docs. I have used this obscure shortcut hundreds of times over the years.
