Backcountry skiing, or ski touring, is when instead of taking the chair lift up you hike! This provides plenty more freedom of where one can ski but it also means you have to work for it. There is a barrier to entry in that you need gear and some knowledge of avalanche safety. This year I finally got set up and took my Avalanche Skills Training 1 course.

After years just skiing at the resort, I have found I enjoy ski touring much more. Here is why:

### The adventure

With touring you can ski anywhere you want (within reason). This means that it takes preparation and planning, the experience lasts longer than just the time spent skiing. You first have to identify potential locations and check avalanche ratings and reports. Once you have selected a location you need to navigate and find your own route through mountainous terrain. Every time you head out it is a new experience in a new location. The views are always incredible, and I find I appreciate the views much more when I have to earn it.

### The work out

Type 2 fun! Ever heard of it?? While skiing up is work, I have found I really enjoy it. It is easy to get into a meditative rhythm and you are free to appreciate the view or ponder whatever is on your mind. Before you know it you are at the top and checking your stats to see how far you have climbed provides a satisfaction that skiing at a resort just cannot match.

### The turns

The biggest benefit of having to work to get where you want to go is that a lot less people ski there. This means way more fresh tracks! I recently skied at Narao shoulder with my dad and we were putting in fresh tracks in waist deep powder all day! If that isn’t the dream I don’t know what is.

People often ask “Don’t you feel a bit ripped off going up for three hours only to go down for 20 minutes?”. The way I see it, the turns on the way down are just a bonus, the cherry on top. Do I love it? Yes. Would I be sad if it went all that way and the snow sucks? No, I get enough enjoyment out of the first two reasons that it will still be an awesome day spending time in some of the most beautiful places in the world!

Thanks for reading why I love backcountry skiing! If it is something you are interested in make sure to do the proper training and follow avalanche safety guidelines!

> PS: For those interested I recently bought a new ski setup which I very much enjoy. I have 4Frnt Raven 184’s (https://4frnt.com/products/raven) with Atomic backlands bindings ([https://shop.atomic.com/en/products/backland-tour-ad0368.html](https://shop.atomic.com/en/products/backland-tour-ad0368.html)). This new setup is so light compared to my previous setup that it practically propels itself up the mountain!
