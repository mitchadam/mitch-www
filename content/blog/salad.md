I have been eating quite a bit of salad recently. I enjoy eating them for lunch, rather than something carb heavy, because I get less sleepy mid-afternoon. Here are my two favourite salad recipes for you to try!

### My Wifes Favourite Salad

To entertain ourselves during the current lockdown, my Mother and I set out to perfectly recreate a specific salad she enjoys from a local restaurant.

**Ingredients**

- Spinach
- Blackberries
- Strawberries
- Toast Almonds
- Goat Cheese (This is the key! Be liberal with the goat cheese.)
- Chicken

**Dressing** (for a two person serving size)

- 1/8 cup olive oil
- 1/8 cup apple cider vinegar
- Half a lemon squeezed
- Salt and pepper

I highly recommend this one, my mom really nailed the dressing. Also, the berries and goat cheese is a deadly combo.

### Daily Driver

This one is less exciting than the first but is my 'daily driver' because it is easy to make.

**Ingredients**

- Spinach (A lot)
- Cucumber
- Some sort of pre-made vegetable mix (ie power blend, kale blend, etc)
- Avocado (This is the key!)
- Mixed Nuts (Adds good crunch.)

**Dressing** (No measurements, I just eyeball this one.)

- A little olive oil
- A lot of balsamic
- Quarter lemon squeezed
- Guacamole spice

The trick to this one is the avocado, guac spice and squeezed lemon. I really enjoy the creaminess the avocado brings and the guac spice goes well. The lemon adds a touch of zest!

Let me know your favourite salads! I would appreciate dressing ideas because I always default to olive oil and balsamic vinegar, which is great but there must be other combos out there.
