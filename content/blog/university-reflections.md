This weekend I received my iron ring for (almost) completing my engineering undergraduate degree. As my time at the University of Alberta comes to a close, I have been reflecting on the past five years.

Thinking about what 2017 18 year old Mitch would think about 2022 23 year old Mitch has made me realize just how amazing the past five years have been. My university experience has been more than I could have ever dreamed of and more. A bit soft I know, but I am truly grateful for all the experiences and relationships of the past five years and know that 18 year old Mitch would be proud of 23 year old Mitch.

While I know I will not be able to convey the true meaning of these experiences, in this weeks post I would like share some of the memorable aspects of the past five years.

### Collective Struggle

Now that I am out of the trenches, I look back fondly on the times when it was hard. Most of all, I remember the times when I struggled along side my peers. Whether it was working through a two page integral or coming out of an exam and laughing because we didn‚Äôt even know what the question was asking, the struggle is what brought us together.

### Learning

Yes, I have learned more than I ever thought possible about software development. However, the learning I have done over the past five years extends far beyond just domain specific knowledge. It has completely changed the way I think and expanded my capacity to learn. I feel confident tackling hard problems and jumping into new subject areas.

University has also exposed me to a vast area of ideas and concepts.The more I learn, the more I realize just how intricate the world is. ‚ÄúThe only thing I know is how little I know‚Äù.

### Interests

Almost all the interests I am most passionate about I have developed in the past five years: skiing, biking, climbing and reading. Covid allowed me to heavily pursue the outdoor related interests, and I am sure I will continue to do these things for life. Some of the highlights include skiing Grand Daddy Couloir, mountain biking at Three Blind Mice and climbing at Johns Park. As a child I was an avid reader, but feel off for a few years and picked it up again in first year uni. Since then I have read a diverse set of ~90 books. Reading has added just as much, if not more to my learning and development than my $800 lectures have.

### Experiences

I love to scroll though my camera roll and reminisce on many of the amazing experiences I have been fortunate enough to have. While there are a few notable ones such as travelling to 15 countries in the summer of 2018 and living in a six bedroom house on Lake Okanagan with a funicular, I also appreciate many of the smaller moments. Whether it was going out a friends lake, wing Wednesdays or a party-party fun time night out, these things added a lot of joy. Life is lived in these smaller moments, and I try to make sure I appreciate them.

### Relationships

By far the most impactful, and memorable aspect of the past five years have been the relationships that I have been fortunate enough to have. These relationships are the reason the things I have listed above are memorable. From forging new relationships, to deepening old ones I am truly grateful for everyone that has been a part of the last five years.

I look forward to what the next five years have in store.
