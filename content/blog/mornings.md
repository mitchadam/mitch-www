I have always been a morning person. Not only do I like mornings, but I absolutely hate sleeping in. Sleeping in stresses me out even if I don’t have anything pressing to do. Even when I was younger this was the case.

Before I fully understood how to read the time I remember my mom telling me that I needed to stay in bed longer. She explained that I needed to stay in bed until “this number was seven or bigger”. I would lay in bed staring at the digital clock in my room just waiting until the number magically hit seven, not understanding what that meant. I also remember telling my dad to ensure he “woke me up while it was still dark outside”. In the winter this was no problem, but when summer came around and the days became longer I remember getting upset with him because it was now light outside. He tried to explain that I was getting up at the same time, but that the sun was coming up at a different time. I thought he was pulling my leg.

What is it that I like about the morning so much, and dislike about sleeping in?

### Focus

I am most productive in the morning. The first few hours after getting up are when I choose to tackle the hardest things I need to get done that day. In school, this would mean studying that one concept I had been putting off. For work, this is usually tackling the bug that stumped me the day prior or architecting the feature I am working on.

### Mental and Emotional Clarity

Everything seems better in the morning. That problem stressing you the night before seems more manageable in the morning. There is just a greater sense of calm in the morning and my emotional intelligence is greater. When one chooses to get up early it often also means they went to bed at a reasonable time. This lends itself to sleeping well, contributing to the feeling of well-being.

### Feeling Productive

When I get up early I just feel more productive. I love the feeling of eating breakfast knowing that I have already put in a few hours of solid work or got my workout in. Getting up and getting after it sets the tone for the rest of the day.

### Coffee and Oatmeal

The morning means coffee, and usually oatmeal. This is honestly the highlight of my day. I love having my coffee in the morning, it's one of life’s simple pleasures. The act of drinking coffee is a ritual itself, but I also enjoy the mental alertness the caffeine brings. Coupled with a bowl of oatmeal, it may be the greatest meal in the world.

Even on laid-back days, the morning is still enjoyable. Reading, going for coffee or exercising are all great morning activities.
