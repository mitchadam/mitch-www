I finished three books this week and thought I would share thoughts on each.

### Deep Work By Cal Newport

Deep work: intense concentration on a single task that is cognitively difficult. Examples include programming, writing or thinking deeply on a specific topic. Cal distinguishes deep work from shallow work which includes tasks such as checking email or simple administrative tasks. Cell phones and the internet provide a limitless supply of distractions and as a result deep work is becoming increasing rare.

Cal makes the argument that in todays information economy, value is determined by ones ability to learn and ones ability to produce. He suggests that deep work is the way to succeed in both of these areas, without working excessive hours. Deep work, like running, is something that must be trained over time through disciplined work practices.

Overall I enjoyed the book. The main thesis is strong but like many books in the self-development genre the word count could likely be trimmed down. In this commentary, I would like to focus on why deep work is good for mental health.

First, deep work is exercise for the mind. I always feel better after I exercise my body and the same is true for the mind. On days when I constantly switch between part of assignment, lectures and random youtube videos by the end of the day my brain feels like mush. And I never feel like I got anything productive done. The brain is exhausted from having to context switch between so many tasks but was never able to engage with a single task. When I perform a few activities deeply in strictly scheduled time blocks I feel much better at the end of the day, and am able to relax because I feel like I accomplished something. Otherwise I find having trouble relaxing because my mind is worked up and I don't feel satisfied with the day. This has been especially true during covid when there are no external factors enforcing daily structure. I have recently been using this technique to enforce structure and found that I have been feeling better.

Second, deep work takes the mind off the inconsequential day to day problems that inevitably. When focusing on important things small issues get pushed out. This saves on unneeded stress and overanalyzing issues that aren't really issues. According to Cal "the idle mind is the devil's workshop". When there is nothing to think about the mind will fill it with something to worry about.

### The Rosie Project By Graeme Simsion

Far from my usual choice of book, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed this read. I was less focused on the story line and instead was infatuated with the main character. I found in relatable in many aspects...

### The Lessons of History By Will & Ariel Durant

Many big ideas packed into a relatively small book. Recently I have been thinking quite about the advent of technology through capitalism and technologies affect on the current state of humanity. It has been interesting to read of other occurrences in history when similar patterns have arisen. I am still trying to wrap my head around this book so instead of further commentary I will list a few quotes I found thought provoking

"Human history is a brief spot in space, and its first lesson is modesty. At any moment a comet may come too close to the earth and set our little globe turning topsy-turvy in a hectic course, or choke its men and fleas with fumes or heat; or a fragment of the smiling sun may slip off tangentially"

"So the first biological lesson of history is that life is a competition... The second biological lesson of history is that life is selection"

"We conclude that the concentration of wealth is natural and inevitable, and is periodically alleviated by violent or peaceable partial redistribution"

Let me know if you have read any of this books/have any thoughts (you can reply to this email and I will see it)

## Favourite Things of The Week

### [Jocko Willinck on the Jordan Peterson Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA4Bkybx1ps&t=6346s)

I found this podcasting interesting for two reasons:

- Jocko talks about his life long desire to go to war. Something I personally have not felt (at all).
- Both emphasize the importance of writing. Improving my writing is part of the reason I am writing this blog so if anyone has any feedback or resources please share!

### [Spirited Man Series - Van Neistat](https://www.youtube.com/user/VanNeistat)

Unique series which is very different from the usual "WHAT IS UP SUBSCRIBE LIKE LIKE LIKE SUBSCRIBE" youtube culture. Often leaves me a little unsure of how to feel, which I enjoy.
