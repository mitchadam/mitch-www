Iteration is a well agreed upon concept in software development. Instead of building the entire product in one go, build it incrementally. Working in **smaller portions allows developers to learn from each previous stage**. They are able to get the product to the customer sooner, albeit with fewer features, but can more easily make changes. This allows them to adapt the product to the needs of the customer, instead of trying to predict exactly what it is the customer wants from the beginning.

This leads to another concept in software development: **Building the Product Right vs Building the Right Product**. You can build the worlds best robotic pet skunk, but if no one wants a robotic pet skunk then it doesnâ€™t really matter how good yours is. Working iteratively allows one to change direction when things arenâ€™t working, or are working towards the wrong goal.

However, working towards the wrong goal should not be seen as a waste of time. It was a path the needed to be explored in pursuit of the correct one and will provide **opportunity to learn**. Building a robotic skunk will teach someone a lot about robotics, which they can then use to build something people may actually want, such as a robotic dog.

What is the takeaway here? **Just start, then iterate.** It is better to start something than it is to never start all. You may fail and realize you are on the wrong path, but then you can iterate. You can start again only this time knowing more than you did before. If you do this enough times, statistically something is bound to work.

**Waiting for perfection is an excuse one tells themselves to make them feel better about not being who they want to be**.

After hearing an ad for athletic greens pretty much every day for the past few years, I decided to see what the green supplement game was about. Elected to go for a much cheaper alternative. Havenâ€™t made up my mind yet on if it is doing anything.
