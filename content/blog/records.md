Vinyl record players have been revitalized and are quite popular once again. While I do not own one, I like the idea of being limited to the music that you can listen to. It means being more intentional with music choices, and engaging more with each album.

If you were to go to someones place, their record collection would provide insight into who they are. This is especially true if the collection is small and each record was intentionally selected. I also think selecting music by album rather than by song establishes a stronger connection to the music and the artist.

My intentional record collection would be:

- [Rumours - Fleetwood Mac](https://open.spotify.com/album/1bt6q2SruMsBtcerNVtpZB?si=GU8s9Ij_T2eMio4QQqOG7Q)
- [It Was Written - Nas](https://open.spotify.com/album/78Fgb88MY0ECc4GVMejqTg?si=Ect3HbHyTliKLERPjz0mIg)
- [Caress Your Soul - Sticky Fingers](https://open.spotify.com/album/2XiBbHgNjlt3JLz8j2S61k?si=cGN35ADJQ9iIaQRIks6IMw)
- [Sublime - Sublime](https://open.spotify.com/album/14eK347GdWO4mBBx78tsut?si=VPlGdeKdQCWia7i404I4mg)
- [How to Be A Human Being - Glass Animals](https://open.spotify.com/album/6qb9MDR0lfsN9a2pw77uJy?si=rT0Z6ZlkR0-kIDTiCoEjVA)

Perhaps I will have to get a record player and these records.
