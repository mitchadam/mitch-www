Dare I say spring has arrived? I don't want to jynx it...

It appears that everyone is taking advantage of the nice weather. Strava feeds are coming back to life and bike shops are packed. I have been very much enjoying some spring skiing. The past few days I have been skiing in just a shirt and sunnies! I love not having cold fingers!!!!

On a podcast that I recently listened to, they were discussing how mindsets and interests vary depending on what part of the US someone lived in. One point brought up was that people who live in places with cold winters appreciate the warm weather more. I think that this is true. Evidence of this can easily be seen by looking at how much busier the trails are getting. It is good to see people getting out. I love winter, but by this time I am ready for warm weather and a different set of outdoor activities.

I think it is better to live somewhere with four distinct seasons. Having seasons adds variety to the year and an opportunity to reset. Additionally, each season has its own activities associated with it. Sitting inside by the fire drinking a hot drink after a day of skiing sounds a lot less appealing when it is 30 degrees out and light until 10 pm. Equally as unappealing is having an afternoon barbecue at the park with cold beers when it is -30 and snowing. Distinct seasons simply keep life interesting.

While ski season is coming to a close, I am excited to get back on the bike! I hope everyone gets some good outdoor physical activity in and enjoys the weather.
