If I am being honest, I was not particularly in the mood to write this today. But, a bad workout is better than no workout so here I am! I was not in the mood to write this because I am feeling a tad worn out from the physical activities I have done over the past few days. I think this is great, in my eyes it means I am doing things right.

Being active outdoors brings me more enjoyment than any other activity. Fresh air and endorphins put anyone in a good mood. However, there is one thing I enjoy more than being active outdoors: being active out doors in the morning. This is my favourite thing. The stillness of the morning is what makes this so enjoyable. The trails are not busy, the air is crisp and everything just seems quiet.

Anyways, all I am sharing with you today is that I was too tired to write something meaningful. But I am ok with feeling that way because it means I was doing what I enjoy. And my favourite thing is being active outdoors in the morning.

## Favourite Things of The Week

### Breath - James Nestor

While I found the ideas of the book interesting, James Nestor uses an excessive amount of anecdotal stories to support his claims (aka make the book long enough to meet publishing constraints). I would recommend just skimming and pulling out actual facts and techniques.

This may sound crazy but I have started taping my mouth shut at night while I sleep to force myself to breath through my nose. Still deciding if this does anything.

### Anthony Bourdain No Reservations - Mozambique (S8 E1)

Was looking for some mindless entertainment and threw on an episode of _No Reservations_. Bourdain does an amazing job of putting experiences and emotions to language. I enjoy the way he describes cultures and how he ties the food into the "cultural vibe"

### Climb!

Went for the first climb of the season today! Some rust to work off...
