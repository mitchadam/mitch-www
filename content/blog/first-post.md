Hello World, this is my first blog post! Woohoo!

### Why am I starting a blog?

I am starting this blog for myself, for two reasons. First, it is a good way to force myself to summarize my thoughts in a more formal manner. By publicly sharing my thoughts, I will likely spend more time thinking about how I can summarize and word them succinctly. Secondly, I don‚Äôt really know what myself one month, one year or ten years ago was thinking. This will be a nice way for me to have some insight into who I was previously. It will also serve as writing practice, which I could probably use.

### What can you expect to find on this blog?

Good question. I am setting no parameters for what I must write about. The only requirement is that I must write once a week. There will likely be a wide variety in topics ranging from skiing, to reading to water bottles.

I am hoping that by forcing myself to write every week I will think more critically about things, which may provide some insight. This is more about the act of writing than the content being produced, perhaps an interesting experiment. These two videos sparked this idea for me: [https://youtu.be/M6NsEDwHHiE](https://youtu.be/M6NsEDwHHiE) and [https://youtu.be/vyVpRiqOvt4](https://youtu.be/vyVpRiqOvt4)

### Who I am?

I googled ‚Äúmy first blog post‚Äù to try and make this thing a bit longer and the first article that came up told me to share who I am. Well if you are reading this and you don‚Äôt know who I am, then I am impressed. Well honestly if anyone is reading this I am impressed. But if you don‚Äôt know who I am either 1) this blog went VIRAL and I will probably have written other things about me or 2) You are a Russian SPY, in which case I don‚Äôt want you to know who I am.

That is all for my first post! Stay tuned for more!
