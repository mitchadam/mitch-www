I would not describe myself as a movie person. I struggle with committing the amount of time needed to watch most movies. However, I do thoroughly enjoy Tarantino Movies. I find them to have much more character than these foo-foo-big-budget-superhero movies Hollywood is pumping out today. I often have to laugh at the absurdity of many of the scenes.

My Dad and I watched Death proof, one of Tarantino's, last night which is the inspiration for this post. No time was wasted in getting to the quintessential Tarantino distrubedness as the opening movie trailers were enough to make anyone grimace. The story line of Deathproof was much shallower than some of Tarantino's other movies, but the quality of movie came from the scenes. Excessive and absurd car chases made up the bulk of the entertainment factor. I would recommend Deathproof, it was quite unique and for the most part a light watch.

### What Makes a Tarantino Movie

All Tarantino movies have a few common aspects that give them their signature Tarantino-ness. Here a few common traits I have noticed:

- Disturbed
  - All his movies have at least a few overly gruesome scenes that go on just a bit too long. He has a special mind to come up with some of these things, but this gives the movies a comedic feel.
- Craftsmanship
  - Every aspect of the movies works together to create a theme and produce a certain feel. From the opening credits to "reel missing" scenes to the music, everything always fits together. His movies are a piece art.
  - I really like the way his movies are shot. There are always unique camera angle, and the story is often told in different parts.
- Dialog
  - Tarantino is able to make the dialog seem casual yet witty and often vulgar. Each word a character says is intentional and serves a purpose.

### My Favourite Movies

My favourite Tarantino movies are Inglorious Bastards and Kill Bill. Inglorious Bastards is hilarious movie about a serious subject, told in an outrageous manner. And how can you not love the fight scenes in Kill Bill??

My current list of favourite movies in no order:

- Inglorious Bastards
- The Godfather
- Fight Club
- Apocalypse Now
- Kill Bill

> Every time you play a hand differently from the way you would have played it if you could see all your opponents' cards, they gain; and every time you play your hand the same way you would have played it if you could see all their cards, they lose. Conversely, every time opponents play their hands differently from the way they would have if they could see all your cards, you gain; and every time they play their hands the same way they would have played if they could see all your cards, you lose - **David Sklansky** (Fundamental Theorem of Poker)
